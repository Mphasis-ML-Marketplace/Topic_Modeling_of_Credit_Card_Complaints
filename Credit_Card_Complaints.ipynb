    "# Mphasis Topic Modeling of Credit Card Complaints\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Modelling based solution for customer complaints about Credit Card services. The solution clusters customer complaints into topics based on the narratives provided. Given a set of customer complaints narratives, this solution identifies for each complaint the top three issues mentioned in the narrative. The task of identifying what credit card specific issue is being mentioned in a customer complaint requires human involvement and the same is being automated with this solution. \n",

    "To run this algorithm you need to have access to the following AWS Services:\n",
    "- Access to AWS SageMaker and the model package.\n",
    "- An S3 bucket to specify input/output.\n",

"This all stemmed from a fraudulent charge from XXXX which closed over a year ago from covid. initially, it took months to resolve which I did after days on the phone with Comenity XXXX Visa. A year later charges appear from XXXX in XXXX NY which we have never stepped foot in ( my husband was a member in XXXX NJ ) and I called Comeninty for weeks and finally got a so-called supervisor in their Fraud dept who said he will block the merchant from further access on my credit card and to pay the bill and I will see the credit next month. I then receive a letter a couple of weeks later from Comenity stating the dispute can not go further as they did not have enough information. I contact them again and speak to a supervisor who informs me there is nothing they can do and the person I spoke to initially who handled it was in fact not a supervisor but a customer service rep. Comenity is supposed to protect their customers from fraudulent activity which clearly is, XXXX XXXX Attorney General has already filed a class-action lawsuit with XXXX ( new XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as XXXX XXXX entity of XXXX is under investigation. I finally today was able to speak to someone in a supervisory position "" XXXX '' ( the ONLY person to show concern and willing to handle ) who is sending new cards and will follow up. Shame on Comenity Bank XXXX Ohio for their lack of consumer protection and to outright lie about policies, procedures and their personal title/rank within their organization and their neglect to protect their customers with such a public fraudulent merchant as XXXX that the attorney general has filed suit against them."
"I have this same problem with all Synchrony credit cards. They do not follow standard business practices when accessing payment amount due, late fees, etc. example. Purchased 800 item from XXXX XXXX   via Synchrony card. Terms are 36 months, no interest, payments {$23.00} a month. Purchased made right after XXXX XXXX. Made a {$200.00} payment XXXX XXXX. Did not show up. I thought payment did not go through. Paid again XXXX XXXX, XXXX another {$200.00}. Called and explained. They send back my {$200.00} in a check. Next statement shows the original purchase plus another {$200.00} purchase. Payment now due in XXXX. I paid XXXX?. Dollars. Next statement shows a payment due of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX because of their error. Called once and was placed on hold twice and then hung up on. I am currently on second call with 20 minutes in and probably will eat no answer. Second time I spoke with XXXX operator number XXXX. Still on hold. 

Second Synchrony with XXXX. Can get refunds but payment due is still based on old incorrect amount. W late charge if you pay pay, ent. Asked on erroneous amount. They say they cant fix it."
"I received a mailed pre-approved for an Aspire credit card with a {$1000.00} credit limit subject to verification of eligibility .The pre-approved card offer reportedly provides cards immediately after the consumer calls ( XXXX ) or accepts the offer online with the acceptance code that has been provided in the mailed offer. However, when I called to accept the offer along with acceptance code I was declined for no apparent reason. I was not approved immediately despite my eligibility.I was informed that I would receive a letter or email informing of the results of my application ( which was done con- ducting a hard credit check ) .I thought this was somewhat strange. I called back the next day and was advised by a customer service rep. that my application was declined, Further investigation of Aspire revealed numerous negative reviews fro other comsumers.Most that seem highly questionable and reported as a scam For your investigation of the matter, Aspire can be contacted by calling XXXX XXXX. This number is to their customer service department .This card company should be closed. 

Thank You. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
